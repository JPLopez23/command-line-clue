## Notes
*Use this space to record your findings and deductions...*
I found postman in the park. 

The crime scene was in the science lab 

Silver watch found in school

Walkin stick in town hall 

The mayor in town hall

I've already seen all the places and read all the txt for clues, objects and people and didn't find any more information, so I can't say who did it, just that it was in the school science lab.

Location of the crime is still unknown - the room must have been empty when it happened...
